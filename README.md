# Sensor_reading-Anomaly-Prediction
* This project finds unusual or faulty sensor readings using smart techniques and machine learning (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier).

* The notebook shows how the data is cleaned, explored, and used to build models that detect these odd readings.

* It can help in real-life situations like spotting problems in machines early to avoid damage.

* The code is written in Python using tools like pandas, scikit-learn, and it's easy to understand and build on.
